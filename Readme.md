# Batch Explorer Localization branch

This branch is a buffer for localization files(xlf)

English localizations gets extracted from all the `i18n.yml` files in the master branch and bunlded into a single xliff file.
That file is then copied into this branch and pushed.

Localization team will update the other resource files which will get compiled back to a json format.
