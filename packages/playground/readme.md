# Playground

The playground is a UI for developing/testing Batch Explorer components. Like the Fluent UI “Controls” page or the Azure Portal Playground, it provides the ability to render controls with various options selected, using different themes, etc. It can be rendered either inside the standalone web or desktop versions of Batch Explorer.
